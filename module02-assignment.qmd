# Integrative Assignment: Module 2 – Type Conversion, Expressions, and Business Computations

## Overview

In this assignment, you will consolidate your understanding of Module 2 concepts. You will create a Python program that uses type conversion, arithmetic expressions (applying the order of operations), and simple business computations to calculate the net price and total revenue for a product. This assignment will reinforce how to convert data types, perform arithmetic operations, and format your output using f-strings.

## Objectives

By completing this assignment, you will:
- **Convert Data Types:** Use Python’s built-in functions (`int()`, `float()`, and `str()`) to convert values from one type to another.
- **Evaluate Arithmetic Expressions:** Apply operators such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, floor division, modulo, and exponentiation.
- **Apply the Order of Operations:** Use parentheses to correctly structure and evaluate expressions.
- **Manipulate Strings:** Use f-strings to display results in a formatted manner.
- **Solve a Business Problem:** Compute the net price of a product (after applying tax and discount) and then calculate the total revenue.

## Assignment Description

Imagine you work as a data analyst for a retail company. Your task is to develop a Python program that calculates the net price and total revenue for a product using the following steps:

1. **Define Variables:**
- Create a variable for the product name (string).
- Create a variable for the number of units sold (as a string, which you will convert to an integer).
- Create a variable for the price per unit (as a string, which you will convert to a float).
- Create a variable for the tax rate (float).
- Create a variable for the discount rate (float).
2. **Type Conversion:**
- Convert the number of units sold from a string to an integer.
- Convert the price per unit from a string to a float.
3. **Calculate Net Price:**
- Calculate the taxed price by adding the tax to the original price.
- Then, apply the discount to the taxed price.  
     *Hint: Use parentheses to ensure the tax is added before the discount is subtracted.*
4. **Calculate Total Revenue:**
- Multiply the net price by the number of units sold.
5. **Display a Summary Message:**
- Use an f-string with the `print()` function to output a summary that includes:
  - Product name
  - Net price (formatted to 2 decimal places)
  - Total revenue (formatted to 2 decimal places)
6. **Comment Your Code:**
- Include clear, descriptive comments throughout your code to explain each step.

## Starter Code

Below is a starter code template. This assignment is a bit more challenging than the last, because you must create all of the content. This will help reinforce your learnings from Module01 and Module02. 

```python

# insert your code here

```

## Submission Guidelines

- Save your completed assignment as a Python file named `module02-assignment.py`.
- Submit your file via Canvas before the deadline.
- Ensure your code runs without errors and meets all the assignment requirements.

**Tip:**  
Before submission, run your code to verify that it produces the expected output. Well-commented and properly formatted code will make your logic clear.

# Marking Rubric

The following rubric will be used to evaluate your assignment. The total possible points for this assignment is **20**.

| Criterion                                  | Points | Description                                                                                       |
|--------------------------------------------|--------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Variable Definition & Data Types**       | 4      | All required variables are defined with correct data types and follow the snake_case convention.  |
| **Type Conversion**                        | 4      | Correctly uses `int()` and `float()` to convert string values to the appropriate numeric types.   |
| **Net Price Calculation**                  | 4      | Uses correct arithmetic and order of operations (with proper parentheses) to compute net price.   |
| **Total Revenue Calculation**              | 3      | Correctly computes total revenue by multiplying net price by units sold.                          |
| **Output Formatting (f-string usage)**     | 3      | Properly uses f-strings to display output, formatted to 2 decimal places.                         |
| **Code Comments & Readability**            | 2      | Clear, descriptive comments and well-organized code.                                             |
| **Total**                                  | **20** |                                                                                                   |
